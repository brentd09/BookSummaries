  - Always I can take another step. If that is to no avail I will take another, and yet another. In truth, one step at a time is not too difficult.
  - Henceforth, I will consider each day's effort as but one blow of my blade against the mighty oak.
  - Each blow, of itself,  may be trifling, and seem of no consequence. Yet from childish swipes the oak will eventually tumble.
  - I will be like the rain drop which washes away the mountain; the ant that devours a tiger.
